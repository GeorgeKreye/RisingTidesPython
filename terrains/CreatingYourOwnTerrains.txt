Here's how to create your own terrain file!
Before you begin, you'll want to look up elevation data for the area you're trying to recreate. Hold on the link where
this data is located for attribution, either if creating one as an extension to this assignment or if you wish to
contribute it to be included with this project.

1. In a plain-text editor, make a new file. You'll want to save it to this directory.

2. The first line of your file should be the string "local", without quotes, all in lower case.

3. The next two lines of the file should be the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

4. The next line indicates how many water sources there are in the world.

5. For each of those water sources, add in two more lines giving the row and column index of where that water source is.

6. After that, write out the grid of Python floats representing the water heights by writing out the data one row at a
 time, with spaces between the heights.

7. Rename your file to have the extension ".terrain".

Hope this helps! Looking forward to seeing what you came up with!
